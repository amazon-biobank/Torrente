Torrente - A BitTorrent client in C++ / Qt
------------------------------------------

1) Install these dependencies:

  - Boost >= 1.65

  - libtorrent-rasterbar >= 1.2.12 (by Arvid Norberg)
      * https://www.libtorrent.org/
      * Be careful: another library (the one used by rTorrent) uses a similar name

  - OpenSSL >= 1.1.1

  - Qt >= 5.9.5

  - zlib >= 1.2.11

  - pkg-config (compile-time only on *nix systems)

  - Python >= 3.5.0 (optional, runtime only)
      * Required by the internal search engine

Dependency version numbers are bumped every once in a while to keep the range of properly tested configurations manageable, even if not strictly required to build.
You may be able to build with older versions of (some of) the dependencies other than the minimum versions specified in the build scripts, but support for such builds is not provided - you are on your own.
Please ensure you are building with an officially supported configuration when reporting bugs.

2a) Compile and install Torrente with Qt graphical interface

  $ ./configure
  $ make && make install
  $ torrente

  will install and execute Torrente.

2b) Compile and install Torrente without Qt graphical interface

  $ ./configure --disable-gui
  $ make && make install
  $ torrente-nox

  will install and execute Torrente.

Please note that there is a "Compilation" section at http://wiki.torrente.org.
